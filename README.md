# Fusion-AutoDownload

This is my proof of concept auto-download mod! Use at your own risk!
This mod will let you auto download Levels, Avatars, and Spawnables from the links in your repositories.txt in the games folder.

Heres a video of it working:

1. This mod requires JevilLib, and JevilLib must be launched twice to work
2. This will probably be pretty laggy
3. I'm not responsible if someone crashes you with their mods
4. This mod doesnt clear the downloaded mods (yet), make sure you have a lot of hard drive space
5. This mod will only download from the repositories.txt file in the BONELABS folder (where the .exe is stored)
6. This mod wont manage updates for your mods at all
7. Good luck stay safe

Message me if there are bugs or if you cant set it up (discord: holadivinus#9244)
